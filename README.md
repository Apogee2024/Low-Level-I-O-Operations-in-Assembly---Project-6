# Project 6 - Low-Level I/O Operations in Assembly

## Description
The program prompts the user to input 10 signed decimal integers, verifies that each input is valid and fits within a 32-bit signed double word (SDWORD), and then stores the values in an array. It displays the running total of the numbers as they are entered, calculates the sum and average, and finally, displays all values entered along with the calculated sum and average. The program also includes custom macros and procedures for handling string input, number validation, and formatted output display.

## Key Features
- Converts user-inputted strings to their numeric equivalents, validating that they fit within a 32-bit SDWORD.
- Maintains and displays a running total of valid numbers entered by the user.
- Calculates and displays the sum and average of the numbers.
- Custom assembly procedures and macros for string handling, number conversion, and output formatting.
- Error handling for invalid input and overflow conditions.

## Technologies Used
- Assembly Language (x86)
- Irvine32 library for low-level I/O operations

## Use Case
This program is a fundamental exercise in low-level programming, focusing on manual management of data and memory, as well as the use of assembly language for arithmetic and string manipulation tasks.
